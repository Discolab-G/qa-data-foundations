## Short resume on how to use GIT

To use GitHub, to share project over GIT, l easier is to first create a repository on GitHub. Inside of it, you can directly upload all iteresting files aleardy on your computer locally. 
When the repository is fist configured, you can then use the function git clone with the repository URL on your computer to import the repository locally. When this is done, you can then start to work on it. 
To ensure to not compromise the existing folder and work, you can start by initialising git (with git init) and then create a new branch to work on. To do so, you may use the fonction Git branch checkout -d "name of the branch". 
While this step is done, you then staart to work. Do not forget to do regular saves of version, with the fonction commit. 

# when your work is done 

You can then use the fonction git push origin "name of the ranch" to upload your work to GitHub. On GitHub portal, you should be able to see the new work notification. 
Yuo can then check differences and wite what changes you made for your collaborator to know, and then pull request. When all your collaborator or your administrator agree, you can then merge your work with the main branch on GitHub. 

When all of this is don,e you may delete your branch locally, with the fonction Git branch -d "name of the branch" 
You should ten have a clean wrk both on GitHub, and a clean workplace locally.
