## HTTP Basics

HTTP, or HyperText Transfer Protocol, is the protocol used for transferring data over the web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between clients (like web browsers) and servers.

Key Components:
- **Client-Server Model**: The client sends a request to the server, and the server responds with the requested data or an error.
- **HTTP Methods**: Common methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (send data), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data), and others like HEAD or OPTIONS.
- **Status Codes**: Indicate the result of the request, such as 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error).
- **Headers**: Provide additional information about the request or response, like content type or authentication.
- **URLs**: Uniform Resource Locators that specify the location of resources on the web.

HTTP is stateless, meaning each request is independent, though sessions can be managed with cookies or tokens.
