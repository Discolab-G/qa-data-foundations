# Welcome to my skill dashboard 

This dashboard is a webapp reachable with this link : https://discolab-g.github.io/qa-data-foundations/

# The objective of this dashboard

The dashboard was made with a pedagogic objective, to reach a clear view of my actual skills, and rooms of improvment. 
It is a on course project, made to ever change, and as such, it can will be updated regularily with my level improvment. 

# The current stakes

The current objective is to reach necessary skills to work as a Junior QA automation, and on the long term reach the end of the QA branch, or get to the data branch. 
I am currently polishing my JavaScript skills with the bug report feature on the evidence page, and after that, I will work on the footer. 

# LLM chart 

As the use of LLM in coding is taking more and more place everyday, and as I use them a lot too (as teachers mostly), I thought it was important to insere a LLM chart in my project. 
This chart does not concern the whole project but the evidence page, and you can find it on the help menu of the evidence page. 
To resume it, I use LLM a lot as teachers, but I restricted code in chat, to ensure I code myself, and understand what I am doing. 

# Feel free to reach for me ! 

As I improve, I still miss lots of clues about how this professional sector works, and as such, I am welcoming any advice about career or IT in general you could give me. 
Feel free to reach me by mail or LinkedIn (links available on GitHub profile) and probably soon by the footer section.
