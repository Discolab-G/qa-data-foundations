# The context of the project

All projects in this folder were made with a pedagogic and portfolio objective. 
 
# LMM chart

We are in a constant changing world, and as LMM are taking a bigger place everyday, some skills demonstrated here may not be required.
Still, as I think there is a need to know the subject to work well with the LMM, I used it as a teacher to train myself.  

As such, my use of LMM (in proof projects) are :   
 - To set the task and objective
 - To mark the result as an acquisition level
 - To explain and find functions
 - To correct 

Every line of code in this folder is understood, developed and validated by me.
