                This is an explanation of my use of HTML in this webpage. I created a new webpage with a header copiing the dashboard. 
                Afterward, I followed the natual order by writting the body content. As it is as of nw, I am only giving this section a title and an alone paragraph.
                To differienciate it from the previous dashboard, I am modifing the class and aria-label of the whoel webpage.

                As the HTML basis are made, I am now adjusting design and order of everything thanks to CSS. 
                I copied color adjustment from the dashboard CSS and modified attribution to each title, paragraph, section... 
                This is the explanation of the modification to a dark theme.
